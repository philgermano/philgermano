Hello,

My name is Phil (he, him) and I am just starting the journey into software development. I'm currently attending General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive flex course. It's been a blast so far. I adore the problem-solving and have been really enjoying myself. We are currently diving into CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. 

I'm a Hudson Valley, NY native. I love camping and exploring the outdoors. My area is lush with forests, lakes, and mountains which are wonderful. I play a lot of tabletop RPGs and have been playing with my current group for around 7 years. I also enjoy reading and have just started "The Invisible Man" by H. G. Wells.

My long term goal is to become a software engineer. Currently, I'm a dental assistant at an endodontists' office. I enjoy helping people get through a generally stressful appointment, and it feels very rewarding. The healthcare industry is currently overextended, so it can also be very stressful.

My career prior to this was primarily limited to various factory positions. I manufactured turbine jet engine parts for Pratt and Whitney. I did prototype development and testing for a solar panel manufacturer and eventually managed their manufacturing plant. My first factory was an ultrasonic welding and plastic injection molding facility. I really enjoyed the troubleshooting and problem-solving that the manufacturing field presented. Isolating an issue in a system, determining likely causes, and finally correcting it was always a thrill. Frustrating at times, but rewarding.
