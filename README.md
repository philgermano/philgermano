Hello,

I'm a Hudson Valley, NY native. I love camping and exploring the outdoors. My area is lush with forests, lakes, and mountains which are wonderful. I play a lot of tabletop RPGs and have been playing with my current group for around 7 years. I also enjoy reading and am in the middle of the "The Invisible Man" by H. G. Wells.

I am a General Assembly SEI alumni. The pace was fast, and I really enjoyed it. GA has really helped cement my interest in programming and development. It was a very rewarding experience, and I'm eager to continue to learn.

I'm currently a dental assistant while working on contract and freelance software engineering and web design projects. The dental is stressful at times but the software development has been a joy.


Please reach out if you'd like to chat or if you have any questions regarding whatever.
