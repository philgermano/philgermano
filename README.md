Hello,

My name is Phil (he,him) and I am just starting the journey into software development. I'm currently attending General Assemlbly's Software Engineering course. It's been a blast so far. I adore the problem solving and have been really enjoying myself. We are currently diving into CSS, HTML, and Javascript. 

I'm a Hudson Valley NY native. I love camping and exploring the outdoors. My area is lush with forests, lakes, and mountains which are wonderful. I play lot of tabletop rpgs and have been playing with my current group for around 7 years. I also enjoy reading and have just started "The Invisible Man" by H. G. Wells.

My long term goal is to become a software engineer. Curerently I'm a dental assistant and office worker at an endodontists office. I enjoy helping people get through a generally stressful appointment and it feels very rewarding. The healthcare industry is currently overextened so it can also be very stressful.

My career prior to this was primarily limited to various factory positions. I manufacturerd turbine jet engine parts for Pratt and Whitney. I did protoyping and testing for a solar panel manufactuerer and eventually managed their manufacturering plant. My first factory was an ultrasonic welding and plastic injection moulding facility. I really enjoyed the troubleshooting and problem solving that the manufacturering field presented. Isolating an issue in a system, determining likely causes, and finally correcting it was always a thrill. Frustrating at times but rewarding.



Please reach out if you'd like to chat or if you have any questions regarding whatever.
