Hello,

My name is Phil and I'm currently attending General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive flex course. It's been a blast so far. I adore the problem-solving and have been really enjoying myself.

I'm a Hudson Valley, NY native. I love camping and exploring the outdoors. My area is lush with forests, lakes, and mountains which are wonderful. I play a lot of tabletop RPGs and have been playing with my current group for around 7 years. I also enjoy reading and am in the middle of the "The Invisible Man" by H. G. Wells.

Currently, I'm a dental assistant at an endodontists' office. I enjoy helping people get through a generally stressful experience, and it feels very rewarding. The healthcare industry is currently extremely overextended though, so it can also be very stressful.

My career prior to this was primarily factories. I manufactured turbine jet engine parts for Pratt and Whitney and solar modules for a small BIPV manufacturer I really enjoyed the troubleshooting and problem-solving that the manufacturing field presented. It can be frustrating at times, but rewarding.


Please reach out if you'd like to chat or if you have any questions regarding whatever.
